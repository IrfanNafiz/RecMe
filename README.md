# RecMe-VoiceRecognizer
 This is a part of the final project of EEE332 Digital Signal Processing Lab 1 conducted under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Md. Raseduzzaman in Shahjalal University of Science and Technology

Training model is implemented in [train_model.py](train_model.py) based off of the [Keras Speaker Recognition Example](https://keras.io/examples/audio/speaker_recognition_using_cnn/#introduction)
Console based application and application functionality is implemented in [app.py](app.py)
GUI is made using pyqt5 framework, with basecode and .ui file in [/pyqt5_ui/](/pyqt5_ui/)
Modified GUI code is implemented [main_ui.py](main_ui.py) and GUI app launcher is [guiapp.py](guiapp.py)
